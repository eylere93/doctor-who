      <h1>Roger Delgado</h1>
      <p><strong><img src="../images/master actors/roger-delgado-edited.jpg" width="250" height="250" class="imagerap">Roger Delgado</strong> (born <strong>Roger Caesar Marius Bernard de Delgado Torres Castillo Roberto</strong>) (1 March 1918-18 June 1973) portrayed the <a href="../Villains/The Master.html">Master</a> in <em>Doctor Who</em>.</p>
      <p>He was born in Whitechapel, London; his father was Spanish and his mother French. Delgado often remarked to <a href="../Actors/John Pertwee.html">Jon Pertwee</a>, a close friend, that this made him a true Cockney, as he was born within the sound of the Bow Bells.</p>
      <p>Delgado worked extensively on the British stage, and on TV, film and radio. He appeared in the 1955 BBC Television serial <em>Quatermass II</em>, had a role in the Powell and Pressburger war classic <em>Battle of the River Plate</em>, and came to wide popular attention in Britain when he played the duplicitous Spanish envoy Mendoza in the 1961 ITV series <em>Sir Francis Drake</em>, after which he was much in demand. His saturnine looks meant that he was frequently cast as a villain and he appeared in many noted British action-adventure TV series of the 1960s, including <em>The Avengers</em>, <em>The Champions</em>, <em>Danger Man</em>, <em>The Saint</em>, <em>The Power Game</em>, <em>Crossfire</em> and <em>Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)</em> — as well as <em>The Zoo Gang</em> (1973), which would sadly be his last ever on-screen appearance. His film roles included one of the members of the title organisation in <em>The Assassination Bureau</em>, starring Diana Rigg and Oliver Reed.</p>
      <p>He made his first appearance in <em>Doctor Who</em> in the 1971 adventure <em>Terror of the Autons</em>. He subsequently reprised the role of the Master in many of the <a href="../The Doctors/Third Doctor.html">Third Doctor's</a> serials. At Delgado's request, the Master's story arc was to have ended in <em>The Final Game</em>. Sadly, Delgado's sudden death forced the story to be scrapped, while the role has since been played by several other actors.    </p>
